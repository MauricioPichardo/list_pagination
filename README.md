The overall intent of the project is to create a pagination of a list of students, allowing only 10 to be viewable at any one time.  Utilizing Javascript this is done automatically no matter the size of the list.   

Basic Functions
showPage -limits viewable list items to those within the defined index 
appendPageLinks - creates the underlying pagination links that defines index

Project is set to start at page 1 

Javascript was written by me, all css and Html was provided by Treehouse.
